title : Ethernet Refresher & Switch Overflows & ARP Spoofing & DHCP Attacks
//application 
//transport 
//network
need to add some details: 
eavesdropping(pastive) & spoofing(active):
spoofing concern about the path: off-path & on-path
    link
    physical


ethernet basics:
    6 byte addr
    ifconfig -a (linux)     or       tcpdump -D (windows)
    golbally unique
    broadcast ethernet

cam table ( switch ): stands for content addressable memory
    have limited size
    store information like MAC addr
-----> CAM overflow:
            being brodcast ----> opening more opportunitie sniffing 
            how to solve: countermeasures or port security lock down port and sends an SNMP trap 

port security:
    limit numbers of MAC addr
    timers on how long the MAC address 



IP
    four bytes
    ifconfig -a
ARP: address resolution and reverse address resolution
ARP Spoofing:
    ARP poisoning
cloning attack:
